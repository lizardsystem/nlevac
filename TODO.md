TODO
====

Important
---------
* Offer reachability and point-to-point routing / viz types
* Save routes in a seperate table for fast redrawing of saved scenarios


Would be nice
-------------
* Draw route polygons using their geometry instead concatenating their edge latlngs
* Exclude 'floodzones' from the Driving Distance results


Maybe
-----
* Include neighboring country OSM data for more realistic routing
* Export to png option
